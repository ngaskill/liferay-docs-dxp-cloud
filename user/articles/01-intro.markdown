# What is DXP Cloud?

Liferay DXP Cloud is a secure, reliable enterprise cloud platform (PaaS) that 
simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of Liferay DXP. DXP Cloud 
provides autoscaling, development tools, environments, monitoring, and much 
more, all designed with years of in-house Liferay expertise. 

For you, this means one thing: *value*. DXP Cloud does the heavy lifting 
for you. Gone are the days of having to manage your own servers, networking, 
security, monitoring, installation, clustering, scaling, load balancing, 
backups, and more. And because you no longer have to host and manage your own 
infrastructure, you can focus on what matters: delivering new features and 
applications to your customers. DXP Cloud has you covered there too. 

DXP Cloud accelerates enterprise development and deployment by providing a 
DevOps platform for Liferay DXP. DXP Cloud 

-   Integrates with Jenkins and GitHub to provide continuous integration (CI) 
    and continuous delivery (CD). 
-   Contains different environments for different purposes (e.g., dev, testing, 
    production). 
-   Provides tools that help you manage builds and deployments across 
    environments. 

This adds up to faster and more reliable time to market.

### High Availability

Deliver high-availability, zero-downtime deployments to ensure that 
mission-critical sites stay online. DXP Cloud supports the creation of fault 
tolerance processes to meet organizations' unique needs and detect and repair 
common server problems as they occur. This helps prevent small programming 
errors from accumulating and causing a server crash, without the need to 
allocate additional resources. 

### Development Cycle

Streamline development with a full CI/CD strategy. For each new commit or pull 
request, DXP Cloud triggers a new build that can be deployed to your QA, UAT, 
or production environment.

### Application Management

Keep track of application performance with real-time build and deployment logs. 
DevOps teams can analyze stack traces and troubleshoot bugs from their web 
console and command-line interface, or download the logs for use in their 
preferred tools.

### Monitoring

DXP Cloud delivers detailed performance metrics so IT teams can understand the 
health and compute requirements of their sites over time. Administrators can 
use out-of-the-box Dynatrace integration to quickly understand CPU and memory 
usage, data transfer rates, and more.

### Auto-scaling

Dynamically scale bandwidth and compute capacity to maintain steady performance 
through traffic peaks. This helps IT teams automatically address unexpected 
traffic flows and avoid service disruptions. Similarly, unneeded resources can 
be downscaled during periods of lower activity. Teams receive automatic 
notifications and email alerts regarding instance usage so they can manage 
resources with confidence.

### Governance

Administrators can deliver maximum productivity and security by adding or 
removing people from teams and managing permissions within each project 
environment. With DXP Cloud, there's no need to develop and deploy a separate 
permissioning tool to fit your organization's DevOps workflow; this 
functionality is available out-of-the-box.

### Backup, Recovery, and Security

DXP Cloud provides automatic, secure backups to ensure that data and documents 
are protected and ready for restoration in case of critical data corruption or 
failure. Encryption at rest ensures that sensitive data saved on disks isn't 
readable by any user or application without a valid key. DXP Cloud delivers 
data through multi-region architecture to ensure high availability.
