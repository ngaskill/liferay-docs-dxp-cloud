# Services

DXP Cloud contains several built-in services that provide its functionality and 
help customers manage their projects. Each service can be customized to fit each 
project's needs. 

## Available Services

**Backup Service:** Creates regular backups of the Liferay DXP database and 
Document Library. 

**Liferay DXP Service:** Runs the Liferay DXP instance. 

**Web Server Service:** Handles all traffic from users and acts as a 
high-performance web server. 

**Database Service:** Provides a distributed relational database service that 
simplifies the setup, operation, and scaling of the applications. 

**Search Service:** Provides the full-text search engine for the Liferay DXP 
application. 

## Updating Service Images

Check the 
[services changelog](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/categories/360001192512-Liferay-DXP-Cloud-Announcements) 
frequently to make sure the project is using the most up-to-date service images. 
All Liferay DXP Cloud images are hosted at 
[https://hub.docker.com/u/liferaycloud](https://hub.docker.com/u/liferaycloud). 

After finding the latest images, update the DXP Cloud workspace's 
`gradle.properties`.

Several services use third-party images as a foundation (e.g., Elasticsearch, 
NGINX, and Jenkins). Although these images get regular updates from their 
maintainers, Liferay updates only the corresponding service when necessary for a 
feature or security. This ensures stability. To update an image's version, 
[open a ticket with our Support team](https://liferay-support.zendesk.com) 
and we will review all requests. The 
[services changelog](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/categories/360001192512-Liferay-DXP-Cloud-Announcements) 
lists any related image updates.
