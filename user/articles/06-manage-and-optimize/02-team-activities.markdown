# Team Activities

To see the team members' activities, click *Activities* on the left menu. The 
page is divided into two sections: *Builds and Deployments* and *General*. 

The *General* section on the *Activities* lists each event, the person who
performed it, and the time stamp. 

The *Builds and Deployments* section lists each build ID and deployment to that 
environment. Clicking on a build ID redirects to the *Builds* page.
