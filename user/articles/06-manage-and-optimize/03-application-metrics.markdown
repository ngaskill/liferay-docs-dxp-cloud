# Application Metrics

With DXP Cloud's built-in monitoring, you can track the following information 
about your service: 

-   CPU usage
-   Memory usage
-   Transfer data

To view this information, select your environment's *Monitoring* tab. Data is
displayed for the past 30 days. You can also select the service, metric, and
time period to display data for.
